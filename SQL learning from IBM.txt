SQL structured query language 

Data - is form of facts like image , txt, jar , or anything 
Database : which acts as repository of data or collection of data which allows user to save , add and update data 
2 types : DBMS and RDBMS
RDBMS : relational database management system > MySQL, DB EXpress c and also oracle 
Data are inter related alos in TABULAR FORM

Basic commands > Create table[ddl] , select[drl], insert[dml] ,update[dml] and delete[dml]  

Info models / data models in SQL 

Information models are conceptual model which stores info about data like name , properties and relationalships 
Hirarchieal model : parent > child like : Renuka parent child me and arvind 
Data Model :
Entity relationship Model  :
Data related to each other 
Laptop is entity and RAM , HDD, SSD , battery are attributes related to entity 
so now laptop is a table and RAM SSD HDD all are entities 

SO each entity is nothing but table 
Entites = table 
Attribute=Column 

Usually they use Entity relationship diagram to create SQL Database it looks like flowchart

ER Relational model Concepts [1970] :simple mathematical terms like relation and set [collection of related data elements ]
relation has 2 types > relation schemas[DataType of attribute] and relation instance [group of data]

Concept 2 :
Referemcing when one entity is refering another entitiy 
Ex: Tata table refers to Tata ev table

Primary key and foreign key 
Primary key : this refers attribute data uniquiely ex sl_no this cant be same it will be different 
Foreign key :will have same attribute of some other table and that arrti bute should be primary key 
EX: Tata (id[PK], name , mileage )
Entity 2 : Tata EV(id[FK], id_EV, name , mileage )

Parent table and Dependent table 
Parent table : table with primary key 
DEPENDENT table : table with foreign keys refering primary key table 

Concept 3:
Relational model constriants/rules followed by busineer : we have 6 rules 
Entity integrity constriant : an entity should have one arrtibute with primary key to define unique values 
this avoids duplicate values 

Referencing integrity constriants : this is to refer other entity by foreign key properly 

Sematic intergrity constriant : giving correct value to attribute rather than garbage value EX TATA(id[PK](1), name(Punch),mileage(kl<incorrect/garbage value>))


Primary Keys
If a relation schema has more than one key, then each key is called a candidate key.One of the candidate keys is designated as the primary key, and the others are called secondary keys.

In a practical relational database, each relation schema must have a primary key.

Rules for primary keys:
The value of the Primary Key must be unique for each instance of the entity.

There can be no missing values( ie. Not Null) for Primary Keys. If the Primary Key is composed of multiple attributes, each of those attributes must have a value for each instance.
The Primary Key is immutable.i.e., once created the value of the Primary Key cannot be changed.
If the Primary Key consists of multiple attributes, none of these values can be updated.

DDL and DML 

Data definbation lanaguage used to define entiries like create , drop , and alter , truncate (delets table data but not table )

Data manupulation language : used to modify arrtibute data --insert , update and delete 

CRUD Operations : create , read , update and delete operations 

1. CREATE TABLE 

create table TATA(
  id int[2] primary key not null,
  name varchar[15] not null
);

2.Insert values 
insert into table_name(attribute_1,attribute_2) values (1,2);



3.select : for reading data from RDBMS also for data retrival 
select attrivute_name from Entity_Name -Query 
select * from TATA where [mileage =12.3] --here where is a filter clause and milege =12.3 is predicate which returns boolean value 
and ouput is called result set 

4.Update and delete DML 

update table_name set column_name = value where condition/predicate

String patterns , Ranges , sets 

String patterns : [like]
select item as system_part from Orders where item like 'S%' order by amount asc

like is used to search any string in database 
% means anything after that pattern 

Ranges :[between]

select item from Orders where amount > 500 and amount <1000 //predicate we describe range 

 we can aslo write like this 
select item from Orders where amount between 100 and 500

Sets :[in]

select * from table where columnValue in (200,5000,300)
we can select multiple values based on mu;tiple column values 

Order by :

this is used to return sorted Values asc or desc 

by default it will be in asc form 
select item from Orders order by amount
select item from Orders order by amount desc


we can also sort using column sequence number 
select item , amount from Orders order by 2 desc
in above query we have reading 2 attributes so we can sort by thses column no 1 or 2 
in result set it will sort desc by 2nd column ie amount 

Group by : VVIMP 

we might have many duplicate data , that can be grouped using group by clause and we can aslo retrive specific data by using  having clause similar to where clause 
but used only in group by '


Ex :

select age,count(age) from  table group by age having age=23
count is method in SQL used to count no of values in column/attribute 
distinct is also method to read values without duplicates 
ex: select distinct(country) from table 
this returns all unique values in column without any duplicates

Playing with multiple tbles using joins 

Join is an opreator 
used in query to retrive data from muliple attrbuites from diffrernt entities 
Joins
table1.attribute1[PK]=table2.attribute1[FK]

two types :
inner join : retives row from two different table with the help of PK and FK
ex : 
select c.first_name ,s.status,o.amount,o.item,count(s.status) from Customers c inner join Shippings s on
c.customer_id=s.customer
inner join Orders o on s.customer=o.order_id group by status having status like 'P%'

outer join : full outer join , left outer join and reight outer join 

we will use where clause to filter
