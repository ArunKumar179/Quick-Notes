SQL structured query language - RDBMS MySQL , Oracle and postreSQL 

database : collection of data in structured manner 

DBMS : Managing that data or database by getting and inserting and updating data 
Ex:Cassandra , hadoop and mangoDb 

Server and client based 

Grapical UI -by establishing the connection 

Command line UI-in cmd prompt 

Schemas > folder in database > collection of database 

DDL : Data defination language: create, alter ,truncate ,drop 

DML : Data manupulatioin lanaguage insert , delete , update 

DRL :Data retrival lanaguage : select




DCL: Data control language for admins to give permission  

create database arun;
drop database arun;
create database if not exist arun;


to create table 

create table tata(slno int(1),name varchar(15), mileage(2))

to insert values 

insert into tata values (1,'punch',22)

alias 

i want to display different column name in output window 
ex: select name n , slno id from tata;
here n and id are alias like arun alias akb , arun alias viper 

select name  model , mileage+4 improved_mileage from tata

if we add int column while select it will add everywhere 

we have only 3 data types > numeric > text> data and time 



DRL 

Arethemetic operater like > .=.,> like select * form employees where salary >200 and age<18 and vacations >= 13

We have conditional operater/ logical operater AND OR NOT 

Select * from employees where salary >2000 and age<18 
for not we need to mention after where only 

select * from employes where not salary is 2000  /// retrives all details where salary is other than 2000



between and in between operator
select name from tata where mileage  between 1 and 10

select name from tata where mileage not between 1 and 10


In and not in operater 
rather than writing selecet * from tata where name ='punch' or name ='tiago' or name ='tigor'
select * from tata where name in('punch','tiago','tigor')


pattern matching operters : like when values are string
